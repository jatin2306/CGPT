        <h1>Your own AI Doctor built around your body</h1>
        <p>If you are living with diabetes, hypertension, or weight struggles, you know how unpredictable the numbers can feel — progress one week, setbacks the next, and no clear sense of what actually helps. ChronicGPT changes that. Your human doctor sets your goals, and your personal AI Doctor learns your body in real time — watching your sleep, meals, glucose, activity, and medications to guide you with simple, clinical-grade decisions every day. It turns confusion into clarity, patterns into progress, and setbacks into signals you can finally understand.
